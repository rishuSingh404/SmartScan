# Resume Parser & Shortlisting Web App

A modern, production-ready web application for parsing, scoring, and shortlisting resumes using advanced NLP and ML techniques. Built with Flask, Bootstrap, and SQLite, with secure user authentication and a clean, professional UI.

---

## 🚀 Features

- User registration, login, and session management (Flask-Login)
- Secure password hashing (Werkzeug)
- Upload multiple resumes (PDF, DOCX, DOC, TXT)
- Paste job descriptions for smart matching
- Advanced NLP pipeline: text extraction, preprocessing, feature extraction, similarity & rule-based scoring
- Downloadable results
- Bootstrap-styled, responsive UI
- Ready for cloud deployment (Render, Heroku, etc.)

## ⚙️ Setup & Deployment

### Local Setup

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Initialize the database:**
   ```python
   from app import db
   db.create_all()
   exit()
   ```

4. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   Visit [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

### Deploy on Render

1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Create a new Web Service on [Render](https://render.com).
3. Set the build/start command:  
   ```
   web: python app.py
   ```
4. Set environment variable `SECRET_KEY` in the Render dashboard.
5. (Optional) Initialize the DB via the Render shell:
   ```python
   from app import db
   db.create_all()
   exit()
   ```

## 🔒 Security

- All sensitive actions require authentication.
- Passwords are hashed and never stored in plain text.
- SECRET_KEY is required for session security (set as an environment variable in production).
